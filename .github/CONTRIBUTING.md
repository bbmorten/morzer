# Contributing Guide

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! This guide helps you get started quickly and make high‑quality contributions.

## Ways to contribute
- Report bugs and propose features via Issues
- Improve docs and examples
- Tackle open issues and submit PRs

## Development workflow
1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch off `main` (or `master`).
2. Make your changes with clear, focused commits.
3. Write or update tests and docs as needed.
4. Ensure CI passes locally when possible.
5. Open a pull request using the PR template.

## Pull request checklist
- PR title follows Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat: add X`, `fix: handle Y`).
- Linked to related issue(s) when applicable.
- Includes tests or rationale if tests are not needed.
- Updates relevant docs or examples.

## Commit messages (recommended)
We recommend using Conventional Commits:
- `feat:` a new feature
- `fix:` a bug fix
- `docs:` documentation only changes
- `chore:` tooling or maintenance changes
- `refactor:` code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test:` adding or improving tests

Examples:
- `feat(api): add pagination to list endpoint`
- `fix(ui): handle null state in details pane`

## Code style
- Keep changes small and focused.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Follow language/tooling linters where applicable.

## Code review
- Be respectful and constructive.
- Prefer questions over directives (e.g., “What do you think about…?”).
- Justify significant tradeoffs or deviations.

## Security
Never include secrets in code or logs. For vulnerabilities, see the Security Policy in `.github/SECURITY.md`.

## Getting help
Use Discussions for questions or ideas, and Issues for actionable work.
