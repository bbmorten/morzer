# Repo instructions (tcpwatch)

When making changes in this repository:

- Keep `README.md` and `USER_GUIDE.md` updated for any user-visible change (UI behavior, capture semantics, packaging/install steps).
- Keep the relevant spec/skill checklist updated (see `.github/skills/tcpwatch-electron/SKILL.md`).
- Prefer small, focused patches; avoid unrelated refactors.
